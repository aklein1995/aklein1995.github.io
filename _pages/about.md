<hr>
I am an active, sport-lover, self-taught and a passionate about technology millenial who was born in 1995. I graduated in Telecommunication Engineering at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) in 2017 and then I completed the consequent M.Sc in Telecommunication Engineering in 2019. 

During my time at college, I was part of [Formula Student Bizkaia](https://www.fsbizkaia.com/) where I was in charge of the control and telemetry group (2015-2017) where my duty took on programming all the control and car communication systems (mainly in C and LabVIEW). Additionally, I pursued an internship in cybersecurity, researching Post-Quantum algorithms to ensure the privacy and pseudonymization of personal data.

In 2019, I embarked on my PhD journey at [Tecnalia](https://www.tecnalia.com/), under the supervision of [Javier Del Ser](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=p_wY0zUAAAAJ&hl=es) and [Esther Villar-Rodriguez](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=pYQnhycAAAAJ&hl=es), diving deep into the complexities of Reinforcement Learning (RL). My research specifically focused on sparse reward problems, emphasizing the importance of exploration in environments where feedback signals are limited. This challenge led me to explore various approaches, including Intrinsic Motivation and Imitation Learning techniques. In 2022, I undertook a research stay at the University of Edinburgh within the [Autonomous Agents Research Group](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Dr. Stefano V. Albrecht](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/stefano-albrecht/). A special mention goes to [Lukas SchÃ¤fer](https://www.lukaschaefer.com/), whose expertise, mentorship and passion for the subject were invaluable.

In 2023, I completed my PhD in Artificial Intelligence with a Cum Laude distinction. My research not only advanced my expertise in RL but also expanded my interests to Explainable AI, Metaheuristic Optimization, Generative Models, and Language Models

Since 2024, I have been serving as a Lecturer at the University of Deusto, where I teach and mentor students in Artificial Intelligence, including overseeing PhD candidates and guiding both undergraduate and postgraduate students.
