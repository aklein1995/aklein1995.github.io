I am an active, sport-lover, self-taught and a passionate about technology millenial who was born in 1995. I graduated in Telecommunication Engineering at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) in 2017 and then I completed the consequent M.Sc in Telecommunication Engineering in 2019. 

During my time at college, I was part of [Formula Student Bizkaia](https://www.fsbizkaia.com/) where I was in charge of the control and telemetry group (2015-2017) where my duty took on programming all the control and car communication systems (mainly in C and LabVIEW). Additionally, I pursued an internship in cybersecurity, researching Post-Quantum algorithms to ensure the privacy and pseudonymization of personal data.

In 2019, I embarked on my PhD journey at [TECNALIA](https://www.tecnalia.com/)/[JRLAB](https://jrlab.science/). My research primarily delves into the realm of Reinforcement Learning (RL). In particular, I am interested in sparse reward problems where the exploration in the environment is crucial to make the agent learn in the absence of dense feedback signals, which can be tackled from the perspective of Intrinsic Motivation and Imitation Learning techniques, among others. Beyond this, I hold interests in several Artificial Intelligence related domains like xAI, Metaheuristic Optimization, Generative Models and Language Models.

To further enhance my understanding and broaden my horizons in these domains, I undertook a research stay at the University of Edinburgh within the [Autonomous Agents Research Group](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/). Under the supervision of [Dr. Stefano V. Albrecht](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/stefano-albrecht/), I had the privilege of collaborating with esteemed researchers. A special mention is needed for [Lukas Sch√§fer](https://www.lukaschaefer.com/), whose expertise, mentorship, and shared passion for the subject were instrumental in my research journey, and I deeply value the insights and guidance he provided.
